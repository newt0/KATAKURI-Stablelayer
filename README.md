# KATAKURI

Katakuri is the first real-time prediction market built for combat sports, integrated directly into live streams. Fans don't just watch. They predict every punch, every round, every moment as it happens. As millions make split-second calls throughout the fight, we capture what they're feeling in real-time and turn that into engagement data the industry has never had before.
